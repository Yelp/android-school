## Mission

At Yelp, we're big believers in continually improving our skills as developers. For the past two years, our Android team has been doing that at our weekly Android School, where we get together and watch some of the best videos from the Android community and beyond. Sometimes these are programming related, but sometimes they're on more general topics like how to be better technical leaders.

We've found this to be immensely useful in growing our skills as software engineers, so we wanted to share it with the wider Android community to help other teams wade through the ocean of content that exists out there.

We'll be updating this once every month or so as we complete new topics in our own Android School!
